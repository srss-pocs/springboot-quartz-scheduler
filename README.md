Quartz Scheduler Use Cases:

Complex Job Scheduling: Manage complex and dynamic job scheduling requirements using cron-like expressions and custom triggers.

Distributed Job Scheduling: Schedule jobs across multiple nodes in a distributed environment using Quartz's clustering capabilities.

Workflow Orchestration: Use Quartz to orchestrate complex workflows by chaining multiple jobs and defining dependencies between them.

Job Persistence: Ensure that scheduled jobs are persisted in the database, allowing for the recovery of jobs in case of system failure or restart.

Enterprise-level Batch Processing: Handle large-scale batch processing tasks efficiently and reliably with Quartz's advanced features and robust architecture.
